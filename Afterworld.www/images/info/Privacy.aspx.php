                        <p>     
                        AFTERWORLD works like this: 
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>
                                a user creates a username and a virtual character that is his or her identity in the AFTERWORLD world
                            </li> 
                            <li>
                                users interact with other users through in-game chat, personal messaging (site contained), 
                                and user forums; privacy settings allow users or parents to restrict communications with other users
                            </li> 
                            <li>
                                each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real estate on which they can build houses, 
                                cars, machines, or anything else you can build with building blocks; these places are called "games"
                            </li>                             
                            <li>
                                users search for, find, and play games made by other users; they play these games with other users 
                                from around the world, and are identified only by their virtual character name
                            </li> 
                            <li>
                                users earn tickets and/or ROBUX, our virtual currency; users earn these in a variety of ways, 
                                and use them to buy items for their characters, including virtual hats, shirts, and pants; 
                                users can also sell these items, earning tickets and/or ROBUX
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                users can purchase premium services, including: Builder’s Club, a monthly subscription that grants 
                                the user more virtual places and a daily allowance, among other things; user may also purchase 
                                ROBUX with which they may buy virtual goods on the site 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                users may sign up to receive our monthly newsletter; they may opt-out at any time by following the 
                                unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication.
                            </li>

                        Requested Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        AFTERWORLD users may play as guests; in this mode, users remain anonymous and interact with the website and game in 
                        Menu Chat Mode – no free chat, no personal messaging to or from users, no posting to the forums, and other 
                        restrictions designed to prevent users from sharing personal information, intentional or otherwise. As guests, 
                        users are unable to save play statistics, accumulate points, share models, or participate in our virtual economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users wishing to save statistics, share models, and participate in the economy are required to enter a username 
                        and password. We advise users to create a username that does not reflect their own name nor reveal personally 
                        identifiable information. We also advise users to pick a password that is not easy to guess, and to not share 
                        that password. For security reasons, we store passwords in encrypted form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        User Names are used for participating in site features and are not used to identify individual users outside of 
                        their activities on our site. Usernames are not passed along to 3rd parties except in the case where a purchase 
                        is made to be credited to the account. In this case our purchasing vendor is given the account name in order 
                        to credit the account when the transaction is completed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All users are asked for, but are not required to give, an email address on signup. Under 13 users are required 
                        to give us a parent email, which is then verified, in order to receive the AFTERWORLD newsletter. Under 13 users 
                        who wish to change or add an email address to their account must contact AFTERWORLD via email at  
                        <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054313/mailto:info@AFTERWORLD.com">info@AFTERWORLD.com</a></span>. 
                        If there is no verified parent email address they are required to provide us with one which is then verified in 
                        order to proceed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Registered users who are under 13 after first signing up are put into Privacy Mode. Privacy Mode limits who 
                        may interact with a user outside of games and limits the user to a whitelist-filtered language system in all 
                        public areas of the site. To opt-in to black-list filtered free-chat mode users must have their parents contact 
                        AFTERWORLD Customer Service for assistance by writing to  
                        <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054313/mailto:info@AFTERWORLD.com">info@AFTERWORLD.com</a></span>. 
                        AFTERWORLD requires a verified email address 
                        for the parents in order to change this setting. In addition, AFTERWORLD uses the verified parent email address to 
                        notify parents of other change requests such as receiving newsletters and participation in certain activities 
                        on the site.

                        All text on the site is filtered proactively to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, age, and 
                        other personally identifiable information regardless of security and privacy settings. All text is also filtered 
                        for profanity, phishing, and adult or suggestive content. Our system is a combination of human and automated 
                        processes; like all filtering technology, our processes are not 100% effective.

                    <p>
                        Users wishing to purchase Builders Club or ROBUX are required to enter billing information, including name, 
                        billing address, credit card or PayPal number, and billing email. For children under 13, we request the 
                        parent’s billing information. Billing information is retained to support customer service inquiries, 
                        but we do not retain the full credit card number.

                        If you (or your child) choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for
                        your friend’s name. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the 
                        site; AFTERWORLD does not store this information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your child opts-in to receiving our monthly newsletter we will send you a notice at the email address provided 
                        during the sign up process in order to allow you to opt them out of receiving it if you wish to do so. You may 
                        opt your child out at any time by clicking the opt-out link in the newsletter verification email. We use your
                        child’s username to send them service related messages and allow other users of the site to communicate with 
                        them. If you no longer wish to allow your child to receive such communications please contact us at 
                         <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054313/mailto:info@AFTERWORLD.com">info@AFTERWORLD.com</a></span>

                        Our tracking approach is industry standard, and includes IP address and non-personally identifiable
                        information such as browser type, and date/time.  We only use IP address, browser type and date/time

                        Options for Parents
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        When a child enters a parent’s email address during signup, the parent receives an email notification of the 
                        account creation and an invitation to review chat and privacy settings for the account. The parent may also 
                        provide their consent to allow their child to receive targeted ads on our site at this time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A parent receiving a verification email has two options. First, the parent can choose not to respond; in 
                        this case, the child remains with all default privacy settings and whitelisted chat options. Second, the 
                        parent can choose to click the link in the email and review the settings; in this case, the child may be 
                        opted-in to free (but filtered) text communications, including free-text chat and personal messaging (site 
                        limited), forum posts, and site commentary. A child can send an email request to their parent to change 
                        the settings at any time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Requests for changes to an account can be made by contacting  <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054313/mailto:info@AFTERWORLD.com">info@AFTERWORLD.com</a></span>. 
                        Parents can close a child’s account by contacting AFTERWORLD customer service at  
                        <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054313/mailto:info@AFTERWORLD.com">info@AFTERWORLD.com</a></span>. This hides the account from all other AFTERWORLD users and 
                        outside parties. The account data is not deleted, but retained internally for three purposes. Billing information 
                        and transaction histories are retained to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries. Public domain 
                        content is retained for use by the community – e.g. a virtual shirt sold by the child to another user is 
                        kept in the system because the recipient now “owns” a copy of that article. Finally, user account history 
                        is retained to support subsequent customer service inquiries. All retained data for a closed account is 
                        private and visible only to employees of AFTERWORLD.

                        We may store the date of birth of your child and graduate a player to have more Web site access once they turn 
                        13. We will notify the parent once their child has reached 13 and may prompt the child to then provide us 
                        with their email address the next time they sign into their account. If your child opts-in to receive our 
                        monthly newsletter we will send you a notice (to the email address your child provides for you). We will 
                        only collect your child’s email address for the sole purpose of sending them the newsletter.
